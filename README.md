Blender addon to speed up the creation of road objects within a scene. 

# Installation

On windows you can download a zip file of the repository, then in Blender go to File -> User Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install Add-on from File

Clicking Save User Settings within this window will ensure that the addon loads everytime you start up Blender. 

After this is done, the add-on can be found at the tools (left) menu of the '3D View' window at the 'Create Road' tab.


# Usage

Set the parameters you would like your road model to have and click 'Create Road'.

A road object will be created and you will be placed into Edit Mode so that you can extrude the road's curve or move individual nodes etc. 

The road object comes with three extremely simple Blender Internal materials which all the road objects created will share.

These materials are intended to be swapped out for your better ones.
